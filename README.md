this is a research project that tries to investigate how well ts-simple-ast works in conjunction with vscode -
and particularly its tree-view 

originally as a simple ts/js outline view - but now that vscode as its own outline view - will have other
objectives - mostly to be a ast representation - configurable, filtrable and manipulable - you can activate
refactors, rename, remove, formatting on individual ast nodes.

on going project very new -WIP
