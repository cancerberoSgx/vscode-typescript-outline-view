# What 

vscode extension that adds a view in explorer panel that shows the Abstract Syntax Tree of active editor
(TypeScript or JavaScript). Live updates and bindings from source code to the AST view. User can manipulate
the ast nodes visually (removing, creating, moving, applying refactors, renaming, etc). Supports filtering and
different AST view modes

## Currently

this is a research project that tries to investigate how well ts-simple-ast works in conjunction with vscode -
and particularly its tree-view 

originally as a simple ts/js outline view - but now that vscode as its own outline view - will have other
objectives - mostly to be a ast representation - configurable, filtrable and manipulable - you can activate
refactors, rename, remove, formatting on individual ast nodes.

on going project very new -WIP
