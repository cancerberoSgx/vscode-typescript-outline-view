# TODO

# issues

 * when files are changed like in "rename" - tsa.sourcefiles gets outdated - une way of solving this is calling
refresh from filesystem(). also the general refresh button should perform updatefromfs for each sourcefile and
also for each open editor dirty update sourcefile content from from there. 

# project

 * change name of the project to something like vscode-ts-js-ast-toolkit - the word AST must be there cause now vscode has a outline for ts and js
 * remove json stuff ids from everywhere 

# js

 * support js and projects without tsconfig and in that case create one for tsaproject. SHould we still use tsa ? or use other thing? we should use the same thing and also offer those ts refactors that apply. 

# Tree nodes

 * name of nodes ? content of nodes ? just kindname or also should consider getText() or identifiers & keywords ? 
 * icons
 * tooltips ?
 * dont miss any treenode feature

# Tree view

 * a third view that show all source files as root files ? (so i can move nodes between files ?)
 * filters ? how to put input text in the view ? filter by kindname, by identifier, etc. indexing ? 
 * expand all and collapse all
 * implement autorefresh by settings

# editor

 * when cursor changes in editor (code) the tree view should follow expanding and scrolling to that node. Make it configurable because of performance
 

## Testing 

 * test on very big files. and very big projects
 * work on changes not savedto fs ? 
 * is tsa well sync when working in the editor (open close, save - edit lots of files, etc ) ? 


# Refactor

 * move drag&drop node
 * change order or children (dragdrop)
 * rename node
 * remove : if tsa.Node.remove user can right click node and remove or by pressing supr. https://dsherret.github.io/ts-simple-ast/manipulation/formatting 
 * formatting action usign : https://dsherret.github.io/ts-simple-ast/manipulation/formatting - get the
   preferences from vscode settings

# nice to have

 * mark tree nodes which are contained by a error diagnostic
 * keybindings dor activating context menu or individual actions like remove - format, rename, refactor, etc



# DONEs

 * show refactor suggestions (like proactive's) by right clicking node - call languageservice getRefactorList() for that node using tsa.
 * two modes getChildren and forEAchChildren
